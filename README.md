This program takes images and turns it into pixel art that you can use as reference in large Minecraft builds.

Just create a virtual environment and run the requirements.txt (pip install -r requirements.txt). After that save your image into the pictures folder and run "./main.sh". The program will then generate a pixel art version of the image for you.
